                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p>Last updated: January 27, 2019</p>
                    <h4>PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h4>
                    <p>Information that could identify you, such as your name, birth date, contact information, and health and financial information is your Personally Identifiable Information. Some information standing alone, such as your zip code are not Personally Identifiable Information, but when they are combined with other information, they can become so—for example, your last name, birthdate and zip code.</p>
                    <p>If you create an account, use our tools, or apply for health insurance, you will be asked to provide Personally Identifiable Information. To take full advantage of our tools and services, it is important that the information is accurate.</p>
                    <p>We, including HPIH, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide customer service, to market or refer products, or request feedback. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, you can opt out by following the instructions in our most recent communication (click “Unsubscribe” in email, text STOP in response to our text on a mobile device).</p>
                    <p>If you decide to apply for a health insurance plan through us, your application will contain Personally Identifiable Information, including health and financial information. We transmit your application to be processed by the carrier or its administrator. We may also contact you to update you on the status of your application, health plan, or fulfill other customer service responsibilities; these communications may include email and texts (if you have subscribed to texts). We do not charge for text messaging, but you may be subject to data charges from your mobile provider. </p>
                    <p>Be assured, we use high-level technology safeguards. Once your application is submitted to the carrier or its administrator, they are also bound to protect your information in accordance with their privacy policy posted on their websites or provided to you.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>ANONYMOUS INFORMATION</h4>
                    <p>Anonymous Information is information that does not identify you. It can include data you give us, like your zip code, age or gender (when not combined with more detailed information). We also collect data such as your IP address, how you found us, what products you search for, and how much time you spend with us. We aggregate this information to understand our customers and to improve our site.</p>
                    <p>Like many companies, we use cookies and other technology to collect Anonymous Information. A cookie is a data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. A cookie makes it more convenient for you to use our site—for example you may not have to reenter information every time you visit. You can disable cookies, just follow the instructions on your web browser. However, without cookies, you may not be able to use some of our customized features.</p>
                    <p>We also use third-party technology, such as Google Analytics, to collect Anonymous Information. In addition to providing us web data, this technology enables us to deliver targeted advertising. We do not control these technologies, nor do we have a say in their privacy policies. You can learn more by visiting www.aboutads.info/consumers and you might be able to opt-out of some of this advertising; visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Opting-out will not block all ads; you may still receive generic ads.</p>
                    <p>Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” preference that signals you do not want your web activity tracked. These features don’t have an industry standard yet, so we currently do not recognize them.</p>


                    <h4>INFORMATION WE SHARE</h4>
                    <p>We will only share your Personally Identifiable Information:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>WITH HPIH, our sister company. HPIH may be the administrator for your selected plan or perform other services including customer support and marketing products/services related to health insurance.</li>
                        <li>IF you authorize us to. For example, if you fill out an application and request that it be submitted to a carrier or a carrier’s administrator for membership processing.</li>
                        <li>IF we collaborate with or hire a company to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a company to manage customer email marketing. We will not permit these companies to share your Personally Identifiable Information or market other services to you without your consent.</li>
                        <li>IF we believe, in good faith, that we are required or permitted to disclose it under law. For example, if we receive a legal order that requires us to assist law enforcement, or if we are resolving a customer dispute.</li>
                        <li>IF we are sold, merged, dissolved, acquired or our ownership is significantly changed. You will be notified of these changes via email and/or a prominent notice on our site.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Anonymous Information does not disclose your identity or sensitive information. We may share this information with third parties to develop business strategies and build partnerships that enhance our site and services.</p>


                    <h4>ACCOUNT CREATION</h4>
                    <p>You may be invited to create an account, which enables you to access information and services quickly, often without having to re-input census and other data. To create an account, you must provide your name, email address and/or telephone number. You must also create a password. Be sure that your password is unique, do not share it with others, and consider changing it every few months to keep it secure. The personally identifiable information in your account is protected and governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <h4>SPECIAL NOTES</h4>
                    <p>We use industry-leading, soundly tested technology and protocols to keep your Personally Identifiable Information safe, and we comply with HIPAA security requirements. Unfortunately, no system is 100% full proof. When sharing your information, please take precautions--use security software, keep your software up to date, and be web wise.</p>

                    <p>Our site is intended for a U.S. audience only and our Privacy Policy is designed to comply with U.S. law. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the new date at the bottom of this Policy and the changes will become effective when posted.</p>
                    <p>By using our site, you are signaling that you accept our Privacy Policy. Please also see our Terms of Use</p>

                    <p>Our site is not intended for, nor directed to, individuals under 18 years of age. If you believe that a child has provided information to us, please contact us.</p>

                    <h4>California Shine the Light Law</h4>
                    <p>If you are resident of California, you have the right to obtain from us a list of what personal information we shared with a third party for direct marketing in the preceding year. The law, California Civil Code Section 1798.83, is called the “Shine The Light” law.</p>
                    <p>You may make your request once a year. It is free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, we currently do not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
