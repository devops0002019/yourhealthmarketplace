                    <p>Last updated: January 27, 2019</p>

                    <h4>Who We Are</h4>
                    <p>gileHealthInsurance, the ecommerce division of HealthPocket, Inc., is a Silicon Valley-based
                        technology company. Our team has decades of experience delivering health insurance solutions to
                        consumers. We are also a licensed agency and are appointed with A rated health insurance
                        carriers offering a broad array of non-ACA health insurance products, as well as supplemental
                        insurance and services.</p>
                    <p>We are the sister company of Health Plan Intermediaries Holdings, LLC d/b/a Health Insurance
                        Innovations (in California d/b/a as HIIQ Insurance Solutions) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
                        Health Insurance Innovations, Inc., which trades on the NASDAQ as HIIQ.</p>


                    <h4>What We Do</h4>
                    <p>We provide the tools so that you can search, compare, find and apply for health insurance
                        products. Think of us as an engine of information.</p>

                    <p>If you find a plan on our site and decide to submit an application, we send your completed
                        application to the entity processing your membership, which may be the carrier or its
                        administrator. Be sure to read the privacy and terms of use policy for the entity processing
                        your policy membership.</p>

                    <p>We are not an insurance carrier, so we don’t underwrite your insurance and we don’t process or
                        manage insurance claims. The insurance carrier handles those services.</p>

                    <h4>We Know Health Insurance</h4>
                    <p>We believe that health insurance is not a one size fits all market. Life is full of unexpected
                        changes and transitions. You may need insurance to cover a short-term gap, help you through a
                        period of unemployment, or have found that Obamacare is unavailable, out of reach, or not the
                        right solution for you. Short Term Health Insurance and Health Benefit Indemnity insurance
                        ("HBI") serve as a flexible and affordable options. Short Term Health Insurance is major medical
                        insurance that will protect you in case of accident or illness. With Short Term health
                        insurance, you will be covered for medical services including hospital stays, doctors and
                        specialist visits, x-rays, and many other procedures.</p>

                    <p>HBI insurance is an indemnity product that offers financial protection for commonly needed
                        medical services, including hospital and doctor services. When you experience a covered medical
                        event, HBI pays a set fee, directly to you or a provider designated by you.</p>

                    <p>You can apply for either type of insurance at any time and you can choose your doctor. That’s why
                        we are proud to offer you these options.</p>

                    <p><b>Short Term Health Insurance and HBI are not Obamacare. </b> They are not required to comply
                        with certain federal market requirements for health insurance, principally those contained in
                        the Affordable Care Act. Be sure to check your policy carefully to make sure you are aware of
                        any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of preexisting conditions or health benefits
                        (such as hospitalization, emergency services, maternity care, preventive care, prescription
                        drugs, and mental health and substance use disorder services). Your policy might also have
                        lifetime and/or annual dollar limits on health benefits. If this coverage expires or you lose
                        eligibility for this coverage, you might have to wait until an open enrollment period to get
                        other health insurance coverage. Also, this coverage is not "minimum essential coverage." If you
                        don’t have minimum essential coverage for any month in 2018, you may have to make a payment when
                        you file your tax return unless you qualify for an exemption from the requirement that you have
                        health coverage for that month.</p>

                    <h4>Dental, Vision and Supplemental Products</h4>
                    <p>We offer Dental and Vision insurance through well-respected carriers. Our dental and vision plans
                        do not require underwriting, which means you are guaranteed approval. Our telemedicine products
                        give your 24x7 access to doctors—you can consult with a doctor via telephone or video chat at
                        your convenience.</p>

                    <p>We also offer supplemental insurance and services In the event of an accident or critical
                        illnesses, supplemental indemnity insurance will make a cash payment to you.. Supplemental
                        insurance products are not designed to replace your major medical insurance. In addition, we
                        offer supplemental services such as telemedicine, which provides you access to a doctor 24x7 for
                        advice on common medical needs. Telemedicine is not intended to replace your primary physician’s
                        care.</p>

                    <p>When considering health insurance, know your health and what you need. If you’re concerned that
                        your major medical does not provide adequate coverage for critical illness, or if you need
                        dental care, then our supplemental insurance and services can fill in those gaps.</p>

                    <h4>Existing Insurance Coverage</h4>
                    <p>If you’ve found a health insurance plan through us, we are thrilled that we were able to help.
                        However, be Insurance Wise.</p>
                    <p>DO NOT CANCEL ANY EXISTING INSURANCE UNTIL YOU RECEIVE WRITTEN CONFIRMATION FROM THE INSURANCE
                        COMPANY TO WHICH YOU ARE APPLYING THAT YOUR NEW POLICY IS IN EFFECT.</p>

                    <h4>Content Ownership</h4>

                        from another country, keep in mind that you will have to comply not just with U.S. law, but the
                        laws of that country.</p>

                        make false or fraudulent applications or purchases.</p>

                        like "deep-links," "page-scrapes," "robots," and "spiders."</p>

                    <h4>Third Party Links</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes our site includes links to third parties. While we hope that these sites are
                        informative, we do not control their content. Including these links on our site is not a sign

                    <p>Either of us can end this Agreement at any time. We may terminate your access to our site and

                        after termination, such as (but not limited to) Content Ownership and Disputes, will survive.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Disputes</h4>
                    <p>You are our VIP and we hope that we become your go to health insurance site. If a dispute does
                        arise, however, then we each agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding
                        its conflict of laws rules, will govern. If the dispute is not eligible for the JAMS Alternative
                        Dispute Resolution process, then we each agree that the claims can only be litigated in the
                        federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California and we each agree to these courts’
                        personal jurisdiction.</p>

                    <h4>Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability</h4>
